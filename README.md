# RTR: Real-Time-Rendering

## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to learn about the foundations of real-time rendering. Instead of using already existing engines we explore underlying principles of modern computer animation and simulation. This project categorizes the topics relating to real-time rendering as:

1. **Viewing:**
  - Cameras in computer graphics
  - Optimization, for example occlusion culling

2. **Lighting**
  - How do we simulate light in computer graphics?
  - Local vs. global illumination methods

3. **Textures**
  - 

4. **Transformation**
  -

5. **Physics**
  - Simulating physically realistic behaviour
  - Particle Systems, Mass-Spring systems
