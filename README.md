# RTR: Real-Time-Rendering

A student's project by Sarah Böning, Everett Mthunzi, Anny-Marleen Hißbach

## Introduction

The main goal of this project was to learn about the foundations of real-time rendering. Instead of using already existing engines we explored the underlying principles of modern computer animation and simulation. In the beginning, we categorized topics related to real-time rendering into five important aspects:  
1. **Viewing:**
  - Cameras in computer graphics
  - Optimization, for example occlusion culling
2. **Lighting**
  - How do we simulate light in computer graphics?
  - Local vs. global illumination methods
3. **Textures**
  - 
4. **Transformation**
  -
5. **Physics**
  - Simulating physically realistic behaviour
  - Particle Systems, Mass-Spring systems


## Presentations

After familiarizing ourselfes with the aspects of real-time rendering, we invested four weeks into researching our field of interest and presenting the gathered information to the other members of the project.

## Framework

Finally, we started implementing chosen features which we unite in this framework. A intermediate demo includes parts of everything we had done during the first half of the project.
